**High‑level plan (learning + execution)**:

1. Verify environment & imports
2. Inspect dataset & metadata
3. Small exploratory analysis (class balance, example images)
4. Sanity training run (1 epoch)
5. Full training with monitoring + checkpoints
6. Quantitative evaluation (ROC/PR/confusion, calibration)
7. Temperature scaling (calibration)
8. Q&A fusion (logistic regression) and CLI integration
9. Explainability evaluation (CAM localization + sanity checks)
10. Ablations/experiments for thesis
11. Write-up: figures, model card, reproducibility notes
